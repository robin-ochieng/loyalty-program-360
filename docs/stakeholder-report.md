# Stakeholder Report

## Executive Summary

Kenbright360 is progressing toward a unified Loyalty & KYC experience. The current build includes a streamlined KYC flow, a clean global navigation, and public authentication pages (frontend flows). Branding improvements (favicon, title) are in place. We are preparing for deeper Supabase integration and loyalty features.

## Key Achievements This Period

- ✅ KYC sidebar corrected — single global navbar and one KYC sidebar on /kyc
- ✅ Favicon updated to rounded SVG and app title set to Kenbright360
- ✅ Public auth flows scaffolded (Sign In/Up, Forgot/Reset Password)

## Upcoming Work / Next Steps

- Implement loyalty points and rewards catalog
- Wire Supabase for persistence (clients, documents, products) and storage policies
- Admin console for KYC reviews and product configuration

## Risks / Dependencies

- Supabase schema and RLS policies need careful setup before enabling writes in production
- Potential design changes may arise from compliance or product decisions

## Timeline Snapshot

- Completed: Global Topbar, Home page, Auth pages (frontend), KYC sidebar, favicon/title
- In Progress: Documentation consolidation
- Planned: Points, rewards, admin dashboards, Supabase RLS
